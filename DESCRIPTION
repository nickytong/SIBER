Title: Systematic Identification of Bimodally Expressed Genes Using
        RNAseq Data
Version: 0.9.5
Author: Pan Tong, Kevin R Coombes

Description: SIBER(Systematic Identification of Bimodally Expressed genes 
 using RNAseq data) effectively identifies bimodally expressed genes from
 RNAseq data based on Bimodality Index. SIBER models the  RNAseq data in
 the finite mixture modeling framework and incorporates mechanisms  for
 dealing with RNAseq normalization. Three types of mixture models are
 implemented,  namely, the mixture of log normal, negative binomial, or 
 generalized poisson distribution.
